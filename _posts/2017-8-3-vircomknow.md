title: The virtual commons: Knowledge
---

The mass of scientific and academic knowledge has widened to such a degree, that no single person can hope to gain a supreme perspective. It is enclosed however behind digital paywalls and enforcement of digital private property. We support right for both single peers and collectives to have the right to privacy, but scientific knowledge is not personal or confidential. Digital private property has become virtual capital for the large distributers of scientific literature. The commons thus becomes a central field of action in the struggle for radical democracy.

Projects such as Library Genesis, a website that enables free access to public knowledge, enforces the commons, but does so illegally. The project is a true enactment of collective resistance. This does not limit the advocacy for a total transformation of the legal structure of virtual property in our various national representative democracies. Scientists are workers who must own the virtual property and share it as collaborators in academic collectives.

Decentral platforms such as BitTorrent should become a tool in political action, replicating virtual property and placing it in the commons. The illegality of collective replication becomes the paradigm of radical political action. Library Genesis does need however to engage further with decentralised torrenting. The legal threats and possibility of censorship should be countered with guerrilla sharing.

Coordinated tracking of an archive of scientific knowledge enabling anyone to participate with data storage.
